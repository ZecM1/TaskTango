# React + Vite Project - Task Tango

## NOTE

This project was created to not only show what I have learned and further improve my knowledge of React but to also serve as a base for my learning of backend and databases as I intend to expand on it in the future.
Due to my lack of knowledge there is no backend for now so everything is saved locally.

No registration is required, password just can't be left empty, only the user name is used and data is saved locally using that username. This allows multiple users and it is safe to use since it is saved locally in the form of a JSON file.

## Description

Task Tango is a task management website that provides a flexible and intuitive platform for users to organize their tasks effectively. The website offers a column-based layout that allows users to categorize and prioritize their tasks across multiple dimensions.

Key Features:

- Column-based Layout: Users can create and customize multiple columns to represent different categories, levels of completion, projects, or time periods.

- Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks can be easily moved between columns, allowing for quick reorganization and prioritization.

- Multiple Worksheets: Users can create and switch between different worksheets, providing the ability to manage various projects or areas of life separately.

- Task Creation: Users can quickly add new tasks by a single push of a button and typing them directly into the interface.
